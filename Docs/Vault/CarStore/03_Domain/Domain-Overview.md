# Domain Overview

Domain layer for CarStore: entities, relationships, invariants, errors, and seed data.

## Context

All business rules are owned by `CarStore.Domain`. Services and controllers may only call domain methods; they do not mutate entity state directly.

## Entities

- [[Brand]] — brand aggregate with name, description, country, founded date, years in business, and car collection.
- [[Car]] — car aggregate with model, VIN, body type, price, stock, availability, mileage, and brand reference.

## Relationship

- One brand has many cars (`Brand.Cars`).
- Each car belongs to one brand (`Car.BrandId` → `Brand`).
- EF Core mapping uses `OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict)` in `CarStoreContext.OnModelCreating`.
- Domain-level guard: `Brand.EnsureCanBeDeleted()` throws `DomainException` when the brand still has cars.

## Error model

- All invariant violations throw `DomainException` (`Src/CarStore.Domain/Exceptions/DomainException.cs`).
- `DomainException` is a plain `Exception` subclass with a message constructor.
- Domain entities never throw `InvalidOperationException`.

## Seed data

- `DataSeeder.Seed(db)` (`Src/CarStore.Domain/Seed/DataSeeder.cs`) is a no-op if any brand or car already exists.
- Seeds 10 brands and 27 cars across body types, some with `Stock = 0` to exercise the `IsAvailable` invariant.
- Persistence is EF Core In-Memory; data resets on every process restart.
